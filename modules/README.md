# Cosys - Modules Overview
A module is a self-contained piece of software that can be used to extend the functionality of the core of cosys. Modules can be used to add new features, or to modify existing ones. 

Modules can be written in any language that supports gRPC, and can be loaded into the core of cosys as long as it complies to the support interface for Golang.
